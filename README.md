## Introduction

This project involves working with a dataset to perform data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and presenting insights. The goal is to gain practical experience in handling real-world data and drawing meaningful conclusions.

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project is [provide dataset details or a link if it's publicly available]. It includes various attributes related to [briefly describe the dataset].

## Installation

To set up the project, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/AbdalrhmanJuber/Data-Science.git
   cd Data-Science
Create a virtual environment and activate it:

sh
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use `venv\Scripts\activate`
Install the required dependencies:

pip install -r requirements.txt
Usage
To run the scripts and perform the analysis, follow these steps:

Ensure the dataset is available in the appropriate directory.

Execute the preprocessing script:

python preprocessing.py
Perform exploratory data analysis:

python eda.py
Generate insights and visualizations:

python insights.py
