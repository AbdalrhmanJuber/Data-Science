## Introduction

This project involves working with a dataset to perform data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and presenting insights. The goal is to gain practical experience in handling real-world data and drawing meaningful conclusions.

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project is https://catalog.data.gov/dataset/electric-vehicle-population-data. It includes various attributes related to Provided by the State of Washington, this dataset displays information about battery electric
vehicles (BEVs) and plug-in hybrid electric vehicles (PHEVs) currently registered through the
Washington State Department of Licensing. Data is separated into 17 different columns, showing
each vehicleâ€™s VIN, county and city of registration, make and model, electric type and electric
range. Vehicle model years range from 2013 to the current year, with metadata being routinely
updated by the Washington government.

## Installation

To set up the project, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/AbdalrhmanJuber/Data-Science.git
   cd Data-Science
